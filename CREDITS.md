## libmmv

The modifications to turn the program, 'mmv' into the library, 'libmmv'
are written by Guy Shaw,

and are Copyright (c) 2015-1026 Guy Shaw.

Many of the components of libmmv are already licensed
under the GNU Public License.

Since the original code for 'mmv' was made freely available
for non-commercial use, those components that are incorporated
into libmmv are to be considered to be covered under two licenses:

  1. the same license as that of mmv for use in mmv; and

  2. the GNU Public License for any other use.

I am not a lawyer, but I think such dual licensing is doable.
