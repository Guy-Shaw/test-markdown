#### Sandbox for Github Markdown files

All other aspects of writing and testing software can be done locally,
but any markdown files pretty much have to be tested on Github, itself.
Even if one has some other markdown rendering spftware, there are variations
in "flavors" of markdown.  To see exactly what the result looks like, you
have to see the results on Github.

So, I use a separate sandbox to do many iterations of rapid
edit-upload-view.  Then, I place the "finished" markdown file
in the repository to which it belongs.
